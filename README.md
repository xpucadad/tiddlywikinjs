This wiki was originally created to learn how to create a plug in.

Since I created it, I have tried a few times to make progress with creating a plug in. I have given up an all of these. The documention is insufficient and the examples are confusing.

However, I may try again.

A side purpose was to create a node.js based tiddlywiki, along with a git repository on a USB stick. This, at least, has been a success.
