* Implemented an afix detection table that lists detection events with tabs for each year. Unfortunately, I can't figure out how to make the default tab to automatically be the one for the current year. I mean I can figure out how to generate the appropriate title, but can't figure out how to access it from within the `<<tabs>>` macro. For now I just hard-coded it.

* Created a tiddler which accepts a filter, lists the selected tiddlers, and provides a button to delete the listed tiddlers.
