title: 2021-11-14 Adding Tiddlers in File System
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

This is a `new` file that I created outside of TW.

If you want to create a tiddler outside of TiddlyWiki, you can add it to the TiddlyWiki by:

# Put the file in the `tiddlers` folder
# Restart the server
# Refresh (or open) the TiddlyWiki.
