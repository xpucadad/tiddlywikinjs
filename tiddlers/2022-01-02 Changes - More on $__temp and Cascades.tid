title: 2022-01-02 Changes - More on $:/temp and Cascades
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

Just to make sure I understood the cascades that caused my temporary file from rendering its contents, I edited the  [[$:/config/ViewTemplateBodyFilters/system]] tiddler by adding a tag check for the `[prefix[$:/temp]]` filter. I changed this filter to `[prefix[$:/temp]!tag[ForceRender]]`.  Any tiddlers beginning with `$:/temp` but without the `ForceRender` tag, will disply the text field of the tiddler rather than rendering it. With the tag, such files will display rendered code (unless subsequent steps in the cascade get triggered).

There are probably better ways to do this. In the health wiki I put the tiddler somewhere else where, unfortunately, it will not get automatically deleted.
