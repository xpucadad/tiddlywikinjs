Eric,

This is Kenneth Reed at 1401 Avenida Montana, Palm Springs, CA 92262. My phone number is (617) 733-6131.

I wanted to add some additional beneficiaries to the appropriate trust documents, and your letter of January 5 spurred me to pull this together.

I was originally thinking of using fixed amounts but worried that if my net worth had been drastically reduced (by medical expenses, for example), the hard-coded amounts might be larger than I might want in that scenario.

So I came up with a solution that will work for me and wanted to insure that it was something that could be expressed appropriately in the trust papers. Basically it calls for distributions based on percentages of the value of some asset or assets on my date of death. 

An example of what I'm thinking of is presented in the attached PDF file. I would like to set up an appointment to discuss whether implementing this would be possible. I’m completely comfortable with a remote meeting, but if, after reviewing the example, you think an in-person meeting would be better, I’m fine with that as long as everyone I would interact with is fully vaccinated.

I look forward to discussing this with you.

Thank you.

Ken
